Make sure you have run the invoke_tf.py command and created a s3.<region>.tfbackend file first, in the Step1 directory.
Then you can place/import/copy/create your new terraform deployment files in this "Step2_main_tf_files_go_here" directory. 
Feel free to rename the directory to something of your choosing.
